      <h1>Life Lately: Trying to Keep Up</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          I’ve been having a hard time keeping up lately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, I said I was back on the bandwagon with weekly blog posts… and then I missed my deadline yesterday. I had a good excuse — but honestly, there’s always an excuse if you go looking for one. Yesterday, I had to drive some visiting family back to the airport. We don’t live in the same countries, so when we do get to spend time together, I just want to be present and enjoy it.

          So this post isn’t really about becoming an electrician — it’s more of a check-in on where I’m at right now.

          I picked my family up on Thursday, and up until then, I’d been keeping up with the course. But during their visit, I didn’t study at all. I’m hoping to change that today — I’ve got a few hours of quiet time lined up while my partner and kids head out for a meal with friends. That should give me a bit of space to focus again.

          Lately, I’ve found myself caught in that familiar tension: I’ve got so many things I’m genuinely interested in, but not enough time or energy to do them all. Sometimes I wonder if I just need more sleep to make the next day feel better. Other times, I question whether I’m just making excuses.

          The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. I think it’s just part of being an adult. You’re dealing with lower energy levels, broken sleep, and the constant tug-of-war between responsibilities and personal goals. You still try to show up for your family, pursue your ambitions, and find some space for yourself in the process — but it’s not easy.

          And of course, there’s the big 9–5 that always seems to “get in the way.” I can’t wait to eventually move on from it. What’s interesting, though, is how it’s evolved — I mostly work for myself now, and I do have the freedom to shift gears once the day job is done. That’s one of the upsides of working a hybrid role. It’s not perfect, but I’m grateful for the flexibility.

          There’s not much else to say today. I’m still trying to find my routine, and I know I will — hopefully by this weekend. I’m not giving up on the goal. I’m just adjusting the pace.

          Stay tuned…
