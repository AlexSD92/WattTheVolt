                    This is perhaps my first real time-management challenge.
                    I’ve been on the course for a couple of weeks now and we’re
                    starting to cover the different types of domestic circuit
                    arrangements—things like TN-C, TN-S, and TT systems. It’s a
                    lot to take in at once, especially without the chance to get
                    hands-on. You’re mostly just looking at wiring
                    configurations and being asked to identify the system, which
                    I’d definitely remember better if I were building one
                    myself. It’s made me realise just how much I’m looking
                    forward to the practical workshop sessions.
                </p>
                <p>To explain briefly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>TN-S</strong> (Terra Neutral Separate): Earth
                        and neutral conductors are separate all the way through.
                        Often used in older installations or where a dedicated
                        earth is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>TN-C</strong> (Terra Neutral Combined): Neutral
                        and earth are combined into one conductor—the PEN
                        conductor—for the whole system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>TN-C-S</strong> (Protective Multiple Earthing or
                        PME): Neutral and earth are combined in the supply but
                        split at the installation. This is the most common setup
                        in the UK today.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>TT</strong> (Terra Terra): Earth comes from a
                        local electrode at the property, independent of the
                        supply. Often found in rural areas or older properties.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The theory’s genuinely interesting—I’m into physics and I
                    love learning how things work—but I’m keen to start making
                    real circuits with my hands.

                    This week, I’m flying to <strong>Malaga, Spain</strong> with
                    my partner and our two little girls to visit my mum and dad.
                    I actually grew up there and still have a lot of family in
                    the area, so it’s more than just a holiday—it’s a return to
                    roots. I’ve got great memories of the place, and I’m really
                    looking forward to getting daily ice creams, going out for
                    food, and playing around in the pool with the kids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The course doesn’t stop though. The lectures I need to get
                    through before practical training are around 3 hours long,
                    and there are quite a few of them. My goal is to complete at
                    least one a day while I’m away. Ideally, I’d like to get the
                    practical side done before Christmas, but it requires five
                    consecutive weekends, so I need to plan carefully.

                    I’ve felt a bit of anxiety creeping in. Last time I did a
                    bootcamp-style course, I pushed myself way too hard. I tied
                    my success in the program to getting a job afterward, and
                    even though I smashed the course, I struggled with job
                    hunting. That led to more hours at the computer, less time
                    with my kids, and a growing sense of frustration and
                    burnout. It became a loop—burned out from effort, frustrated
                    by lack of results, and disconnected from the people I care
                    about most.

                    This time, though, things feel different. I’m still
                    ambitious, but I’ve got a better support system. My
                    partner’s incredible—she helps me find time and buys me
                    space when I need it. If I’m overwhelmed, she helps me plan.
                    She sees where I’m struggling and steps in—not to fix it for
                    me, but to help me fix it myself. That kind of support is
                    gold, and I’m grateful.

                    I’ll be checking in again while I’m away. My aim is to
                    complete five lectures and post once to this blog within the
                    first week. I also want to strike a healthy balance—enough
                    time with my family, and enough progress in my training to
                    keep momentum. If I can manage both, I’ll consider it a win.

                    Thanks for reading. If you’ve gone through something
                    similar, I’d love to hear about it. Drop me a message or
                    subscribe below to stay in the loop.
