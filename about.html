        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            WattTheVolt is a blog about starting from scratch - and wiring up a
            new future.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I'm 33, switching careers, and learning to become an electrician in
            the UK through hands-on training and hard-earned lessons. This space
            documents my real, unfiltered journey - from study notes and tool
            reviews to failed attempts and first wins.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Whether you're a fellow trainee, a career changer, or a curious
            DIYer, you're welcome here. I'm no expert - just someone figuring it
            out one circuit at a time, and sharing everything I learn to help
            others do the same.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            If you're starting late, learning fast, or just wondering if you can
            pull it off, this blog is proof that you can.
