                <p>It’s been a minute since I last posted.</p>
                <p>
                    After finishing up my family holiday in Spain, I found it
                    hard to carve out time to properly sit down and go through
                    my electrician training lectures. I had to return early from
                    the trip to go back to work, and then a week later I was off
                    to Spain again — this time for a bachelor party with
                    friends. Needless to say, progress was delayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I’ve picked it back up over the last couple of weeks.
                    I’ve trooped through most of the lecture content now and
                    have about 10 remaining. That said, because it’s been a
                    while between starting the course and where I am now, I can
                    already see myself revisiting the lectures again when I
                    start digging into the books and taking the trial exams.
                    It’s not a problem — except for the time commitment.

                    Something I’ve noticed about myself: I have a bad habit of
                    trying to run before I can walk. I want to be good at
                    something <em>now</em>. I expect myself to “get it” quickly
                    — and when I don’t, I start criticising myself. What’s
                    strange is, I’d never say that to someone else. I’d never
                    think someone else was taking “too long” to learn a skill.
                    That pressure is something I aim squarely at myself.

                <p>
                    The other day, though, something helped me put it in
                    perspective.
                </p>

                    I was out with my daughter while she rode her bike, and I
                    was just in awe of how far she’d come. I was watching her
                    shift gears and push her pace, and it hit me: she’s come
                    such a long way in such a short time. I bought the bikes in
                    April 2025 — so it's been about five months of consistent
                    practice, maybe 3–4 rides a week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s five months from “don’t let go, Dad” to “go faster!”
                    She’s still a beginner — don’t get me wrong — but a
                    confident one. Watching her made me realise how powerful
                    steady effort really is. We often overlook the slow grind in
                    favour of the big leap. But it’s the slow grind that builds
                    skill.

                    I need to offer myself that same patience. I’m still early
                    in my journey, and it’s okay to take the long route, as long
                    as I keep moving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So yes — this is my first post in a while. If anyone out
                    there has been reading and wondering where I went — thanks
                    for sticking around. I’m back now, and hopefully for good.
                    Consider this a soft reboot and me getting back on the
                    bandwagon.
