                <p>
                    This is my first post here. I'm not really too sure what to
                    say. This blog is kind of an impulse decision—but at the
                    same time, it’s not. Honestly, I’ve made a couple of
                    impulsive decisions in the last month or so. The first was
                    buying a new car. I’ve been driving around a horrendous
                    beater for the last 10 years, and I was finally due an
                    upgrade.

                    It was a 2007 Suzuki Liana that left me stranded more than
                    once on motorways and dual carriageways. The final straw
                    came in February this year—I was driving home from work when
                    I heard something metallic hit the road. I looked in the
                    rear-view mirror and saw my tailpipe rolling away behind me
                    like it was trying to make a run for it. That was it. Time
                    for something that wouldn’t embarrass me at roundabouts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then registered for training to become an electrician. And
                    finally, I decided to start this blog—not just to document
                    my journey, but to share what I learn. Hopefully, once I’m
                    qualified, I’ll use it as a springboard for starting my own
                    business.

                    This isn’t the first time I’ve jumped into something like
                    this. Not long ago, I signed up for a coding bootcamp out of
                    curiosity. The goal was to get sick at coding, go
                    self-employed, and crush it—but it didn’t quite work out
                    that way. While I loved what I learned, I didn’t really feel
                    that the bootcamp prepared me for actual employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn’t leave with one standout project I was proud of—but
                    I left with skills I genuinely value. The hardest part?
                    Getting the front end to talk to the back end. I was using
                    React with Django REST, and I spent hours trying to debug
                    why my cookie-based logins weren’t working. Tutors checked
                    my code, everything looked fine. In the end, I discovered I
                    was in incognito mode the whole time—so no cookies were
                    being saved. Rookie mistake, but a lesson I’ll never forget.

                    If you want to hear more about that journey, fill out the
                    contact form—I’ll even give you a shoutout. Despite the
                    outcome, I still love coding, and the skills I picked up
                    will stick with me for life. And yes—if you're tech-savvy,
                    you’ll notice this is a simple, static blog. That’s
                    intentional. I wanted full control and minimal cost.

                    Anyway, here I am, trying another bootcamp. It wasn’t as
                    impulsive as I might’ve made it seem. I did some
                    research—mostly talking to my dad (he’s got a lot of
                    electrician friends), watching "day in the life" videos, and
                    reading up on industry trends and future demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part of it came from a craving to work with my hands
                    again—not just sit at a desk all day. The bits of my current
                    job I actually enjoy are when I’m out and about, being
                    physical. Plus, I’ve always been a bit of a nerd when it
                    comes to physics and learning how things work. It wasn’t one
                    big moment that pushed me over the edge—more like a slow,
                    dawning realisation:
                    <em>I am so tired of being bored in this office.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to think a desk job was the dream—work-life balance,
                    steady 9–5, consistent salary. But the older I get, the more
                    I realise something’s missing. It’s not about money
                    anymore—it’s about freedom. You can always earn more money,
                    but you can’t earn more time.

                    For me, freedom means making enough money to live well,
                    while actually having the time to enjoy it. I don’t mind
                    working solo, but there’s nothing better than being part of
                    a tight-knit team that clicks. My ideal workday? Wake up
                    early, get on site, crack on with the job, quick lunch, then
                    back at it until the work’s done. Straightforward, physical,
                    satisfying.

                    I think that about wraps it up for now. I just wanted to
                    introduce myself and talk about why I’m doing this. In the
                    future, I plan to post resources for other students, maybe
                    share ideas around starting a business. But mostly, I want
                    this blog to be a space to reflect and document the journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There’s already so much content out there about “how to
                    learn to code” or “how to break into tech,” but most of it
                    feels like it’s selling a dream rather than teaching a
                    craft. I noticed a lot of it is just recycled advice—people
                    trying to position themselves as mentors without even having
                    job experience. It’s easy to fall into the trap of chasing
                    income instead of skill. I want this blog to be the opposite
                    of that—honest, grounded, and real.
