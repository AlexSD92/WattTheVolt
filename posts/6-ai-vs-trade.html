            <section>
                <p>
                    The other day, I saw a quote floating around from Jensen
                    Huang, CEO of Nvidia—the company behind most of the world’s
                    high-performance AI chips. In an interview with Channel 4
                    News, he reportedly said:
                </p>
                <blockquote style="text-align: left">
                    “Electricians and plumbers will be the big winners in the AI
                    race.”
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    I haven’t been able to load the full interview yet (the
                    Channel 4 link was broken at the time), but that quote has
                    popped up in multiple credible places—LinkedIn, X (formerly
                    Twitter), and a few blogs. Whether he said it off-the-cuff
                    or with a bit of weight behind it, I think the quote hits on
                    something real.

                <h2>Why would tradespeople 'win' in the AI race?</h2>
                <p>
                    On the surface, it might sound like an odd claim. Most
                    conversations about AI are filled with buzzwords like
                    machine learning, prompt engineering, AGI, large language
                    models—terms you don’t often hear alongside plumbing and
                    cable runs. But if you dig a little deeper, Huang’s point
                    actually makes a lot of sense.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI can’t fix your wiring:</strong> Hands-on,
                        physical work—especially when it involves unpredictable
                        environments—just isn’t something AI can easily
                        automate. It’s not like coding or data entry. Every
                        house is different. Every job requires problem solving.
                        AI might help, but it can’t pull cables through a wall
                        or install a fuse board for you.
                    </li>
                    <br />

                    <li>
                        <strong>More tech = more infrastructure:</strong> Smart
                        homes, EVs, solar panels, IoT devices—all of these
                        innovations still need physical installation and
                        maintenance. That means more work for skilled
                        tradespeople who understand both electricity and
                        technology.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <strong>Labour value is shifting:</strong> As
                        white-collar jobs become more automatable, skilled
                        manual work may start to climb in both demand and
                        respect. And if that happens, wages could follow.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I think there’s something reassuring about that.
                    In a world full of automation and digital chaos, becoming
                    good at something practical feels like an anchor.

                <h2>Why it matters to me</h2>
                <p>
                    If you’ve read my earlier posts, you’ll know I’m currently
                    training to become an electrician. I’ve worked in offices,
                    I’ve done coding bootcamps, and I’ve explored other paths
                    that were more digital or “future-proof.” But I got tired of
                    sitting still, staring at screens. I wanted to do something
                    real—something I could point to and say:
                    <i>I made that work.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea that a skilled trade might not only survive AI—but
                    actually thrive because of it—adds even more weight to that
                    decision. It’s not that I think I’ll be immune to disruption
                    forever. But I do believe that learning a hands-on trade
                    gives you resilience in a world that’s changing fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s funny—when I was younger, I was told that the future
                    was digital, that everything would be online, that I’d need
                    to work in tech to keep up. But maybe the most future-proof
                    skill of all… is knowing how to wire up the future when it
                    arrives.

                <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Will electricians and plumbers really "win" the AI race? I
                    don’t think it’s about winning or losing. I think it’s about
                    choosing a path that gives you freedom, value, and purpose.
                    For me, that means working with my hands, solving real-world
                    problems, and building something useful.
                </p>
                <p>If the CEO of Nvidia is right, that’s just a bonus.</p>
                <p>
                    And if he’s wrong? I’ll still be learning a skill I
                    respect—and that’s worth something too.
                </p>
