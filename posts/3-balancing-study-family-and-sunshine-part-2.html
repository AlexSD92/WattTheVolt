                <h3>Flying Out to Spain – 27-07-25</h3>
                <p>
                    Two and a half hours doesn’t sound like a lot of time, but
                    when you’re sitting next to strangers on a cramped aircraft
                    going 500+ mph, you’re better off finding something to keep
                    your mind occupied. Jokes aside, the flight isn’t the worst
                    part—it’s the build-up, in my opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a later flight (after my kids’ bedtime), so we had
                    all day to carry on as normal. I went to the gym, we went
                    out for lunch, sorted school cardigans for the girls, tidied
                    the house, watched some TV, had dinner—you get the picture.
                    But at some point, you have to shift gears. Every family has
                    a different threshold for this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some families leave it to the last half hour: pack, taxi,
                    go. Not us. Our prep started weeks ago—mostly for my
                    partner’s benefit (she’s the planner). Personally, I’m happy
                    with a 3–5 hour packing window. Any more and I stress. Any
                    less and I panic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I’m writing this, I’m thinking about how much I want to
                    land. But then comes the *wind-down*—that painfully slow
                    shuffle off the plane. And there’s always someone who takes
                    too long. Not the elderly or families with kids—they’re
                    legends. I mean the people who could’ve moved faster if they
                    hadn’t packed 30 minutes before their taxi arrived. (No
                    offence… but also, kind of offence.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ll leave this note here. I’ve got a window seat, and we’re
                    cruising alongside the sunset. It’s a killer view. I’m
                    taking a few minutes to appreciate the moment. After
                    millions of years of evolution and progress, I get to be
                    here—flying through the sky with coffee in my system and my
                    family by my side. Wild, isn’t it?

                <h3>Summary of Week 1 – 04-08-25</h3>
                <p>
                    I set myself the goal of completing five lectures this week,
                    giving myself a couple of days off to relax. I nearly hit
                    the mark—I completed four. Technically, I could have
                    squeezed in one more, but the lecturer in the last session
                    suggested reviewing the material before the next phase. That
                    felt like a natural pause, and honestly, I needed a moment
                    to digest everything. It’s been a firehose of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the balance between study and family—surprisingly, it
                    worked out well. That’s largely thanks to my partner, who’s
                    incredibly supportive of everything I do. Here's what my
                    days have looked like:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Wake up between 08:00 and 10:00. Breakfast and a strong
                        percolator coffee—arguably the best kind of coffee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Watch the first half of the 3-hour lecture. The lecturer
                        always inserts a 10-minute break midway, which makes for
                        a natural stopping point.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get everyone ready for the beach or pool. Sunscreen,
                        snacks, toys, floaties—the works. We’d usually be out by
                        11:00–12:00, back by 14:00 for lunch prep.
                    </li>
                    <li>Eat around 15:00. Clean up by 16:00.</li>
                    <li>
                        Second coffee and second half of the lecture while the
                        girls relaxed with their tablets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Evening swim or beach time until 20:00. Then back
                        upstairs, dinner for the kids, and bedtime routine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After they were down, we’d either chill on the terrace
                        or sneak out for some local food while my parents stayed
                        with the kids.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    What’s been great is the ability to watch lectures at 2×
                    speed. The lecturer talks slowly to help note-takers, which
                    I appreciate, but it’s too slow for me. With occasional
                    pauses for complex topics, I get through them in about 90
                    minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So far, I’d absolutely recommend this learning style for
                    anyone with a busy life. It’s flexible and designed to fit
                    around your schedule. I know the practical modules will be
                    more rigid, but the weekend options for full-time workers
                    are a real bonus.
