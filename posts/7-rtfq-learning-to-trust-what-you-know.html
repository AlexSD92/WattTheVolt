            <section>
                <p>
                    I struggle often with self-doubt. I rarely feel prepared for
                    something — even when I actually am. Sure, there are moments
                    in life where you *can’t* be fully prepared — like becoming
                    a parent for the first time. But there are also situations
                    where you can absolutely overprepare and still feel
                    uncertain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good example is this course I’m doing. I’ve just finished
                    a mountain of 3-hour lectures — at least 30 of them. That’s
                    a serious chunk of time. And by the end of it, my head felt
                    completely scrambled. I didn’t feel like I understood
                    anything. But that wasn’t true. The knowledge was there — it
                    was just disorganised. Floating around, unindexed, messy.

                <h2>RTFQ – Read The Flipping Question</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, for the first time in this course, I actually put my
                    knowledge (or at least my ability to *find* knowledge) to
                    the test — and I came out with 90%. It felt like relief,
                    pride, and excitement all at once. Funny enough, I even took
                    a screenshot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a 20-question technical mock exam with an open-book
                    policy. At first, the process was slow. The first five
                    questions took me a while as I learned how to navigate the
                    IET On-Site Guide. But once I had that in hand, I moved
                    through the rest of the exam much faster. That experience
                    taught me something valuable: it’s not about memorising
                    everything. It’s about knowing *enough* to know where to
                    look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing the tutor keeps repeating — maybe too often for
                    some — is “RTFQ.” Read. The. Flipping. Question. The first
                    time I heard him say it, I thought it was a bit harsh. But
                    the more I’ve studied, the more I realise he’s right. And
                    it’s not just about literally reading the question. It’s
                    about understanding what you’re reading — the meaning behind
                    it — and how it applies to what you’re doing and what you
                    know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s the soft skill nobody talks about. This is how you
                    become a safe electrician. An effective one. A legal one.
                    You don’t cut corners. You don’t guess. You reference your
                    books. You work by the standards. And honestly, I think
                    that’s kind of cool.

                <h2>The Road Forward</h2>
                <p>
                    If I’m being honest with myself, I’ve still got a long road
                    ahead. But today felt like progress. Real, tangible
                    progress. I’ve got another five mock exams to go before I
                    tackle the real deal. The plan is to space them out — maybe
                    one or two per week — and aim for the real thing in the New
                    Year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that? Hopefully, I’ll move on to the practical
                    training around April, once my annual leave resets. That’ll
                    be the next chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, I’m learning to trust that I *do* know what I’m
                    doing — even if it doesn’t always feel like it.
